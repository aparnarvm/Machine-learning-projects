### 1.  House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
In this project, we are predicting the house prices based on various independent features like size, no of rooms, no of bathrooms, garden etc using Linear Regression from Scikit learn. The MSE, RMSE, and R-squared score indicates that the model is performing poorly. I will try different techniques to improve the model next in the upcoming projects.
